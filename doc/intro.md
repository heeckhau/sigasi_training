# Sigasi Training

## Setup

Requirements:

* Sigasi Studio 3.4
* Valid Sigasi Studio XL Doc licenses for all participants
* Training VHDL sources:

The zip file contains folders with VHDL code for each of the following parts, named `part1` through `part4`.
The VHDL source files contain `TODO` comments, which explain the tasks of the exercises. This document is an extra tool to guide you trough the exercises. It also helps you to keep track of your progress.


## Troubleshooting

* Where are my views? → **Window > Perspective > Reset perspective**
