# VUnit demo project: 74161 style counter

How to use this project:

* Make sure that you have a simulator in your PATH which is supported by VUnit, and that this simulator is configured (e.g. license)
* [Configure VUnit](https://insights.sigasi.com/manual/vunit/#prerequisites) in [Sigasi Studio](https://www.sigasi.com/)
* Navigate to **File > Import... Sigasi > Import a VUnit project**, click **Next >**, enter the **Python Script Location** and click **Finish**
* In the Project Navigator, right-click the project and select **Run VUnit tests**
* Sit back while VUnit compiles the design and testbench and runs the tests
* Check the test results...

If you are keen, create an additional test to check that `clrb` works correctly when the clock is running.
